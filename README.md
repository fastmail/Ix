Ix is a framework for building applications using the [JMAP](http://jmap.io/)
protocol.  Ix provides abstractions for writing method handlers to handle
JMAP requests containing multiple method calls.  It also provides a mapping
layer to automatically provide JMAP's CRUD and windows query interfaces by
mapping to a DBIx::Class schema.

Ix has documentation, but you can probably learn more by reading the tests.
It's also much more heavily tested than it appears, because there are test
suites for internal products built on Ix.  Remember, though:  because Ix is
being changed as much as we want, whenever we want, you can't use the tests as
promises of what will stay the same.  If we change the framework, we'll just
change the tests, too.

To play with Ix, you'll need to install the prereqs that Dist::Zilla will
compute, including at least one that's not on the CPAN:
[Test::PgMonger](https://github.com/fastmail/Test-PgMonger).  You'll also need
a working PostgreSQL install.
